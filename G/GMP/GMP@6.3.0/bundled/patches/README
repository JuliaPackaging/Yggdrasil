Julia applies a patch to GMP that handles "overflow" (out of memory)
via a callback function. GMP 6.3.0 introduced its own mechanism to
handle overflows via an error code.

Since Julia Base calls `__gmp_set_alloc_overflow_function` I
(@eschnett) chose to overwrite the changes to GMP that now handle
overflow in favour of the old mechanism introduced via Julia's
patches. The main reasons are: (a) this works for Julia right away (no
changes to Base necessary), and (b) Julia's patches handle more cases,
i.e. more places where an overflow can occur.
