# Unlike other GAP_pkg_* JLLs, we do *not* set a compat bound for GAP_jll and
# GAP_lib_jll here. Instead GAP.jl is expected to make sure that it uses right
# combination of those JLLs with GAP_pkg_juliainterface. This decoupling is
# important for smooth upgrades, since GAP.jl can in principle work with newer
# GAP_jll versions by transparently building a fresh version of the code in
# GAP_pkg_juliainterface, and ignoring the code in that JLL. But this is
# thwarted if GAP_pkg_juliainterface has an explicit dependency on the old
# GAP_jll.
#
# The only downside is that there is a risk of using a bad combination, but
# that's a small risk, usually immediately detected in CI test, and fixing it
# is easy as it only requires a change to GAP.jl, not to any JLLs.
