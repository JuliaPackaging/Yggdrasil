# ABC is setup for native builds (the arch_flags program and running the
# shell to get other flags), so we need to manually add the arch flags
# here.  Also, the combo of BinaryBuilder and ABC's Makefile always seems
# to override rather than extend CFLAGS, so I've included the whole mess
# here.  Even though we use ABC_USE_STDINT_H=1 it doesn't work as
# expected, so we only use it here to prevent the Makefile from running
# the arch_flags executable, which will always fail when cross compiling.
# Note that neither -DLIN nor -DLIN64 actually appear to be used anymore but
# still set here anyway
