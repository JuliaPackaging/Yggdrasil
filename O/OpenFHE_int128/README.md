The OpenFHE library works with both 64-bit and 128-bit integers.

This package builds the 128-bit version.

To build the default 64-bit version, use [OpenFHE](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/tree/master/O/OpenFHE).

Most of the build steps for [OpenFHE](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/tree/master/O/OpenFHE)
and OpenFHE_int128 are the same, so the shared parts are in the
[../OpenFHE/common.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/tree/master/O/OpenFHE/common.jl) script.
