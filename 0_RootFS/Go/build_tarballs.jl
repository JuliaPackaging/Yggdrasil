### Instructions for adding a new version of the Go toolchain
#
# * find the latest stable releases at https://go.dev/dl/, update the `version`
#   variable and the SHA256 hash of the release tarball in the sources, the
#   expected checksum is provided in the download page.
# * To deploy the shard and automatically update your BinaryBuilderBase's
#   `Artifacts.toml`, use the `--deploy` flag to the `build_tarballs.jl` script.
#   You can build & deploy by running:
#
#      julia build_tarballs.jl --debug --verbose --deploy
#
