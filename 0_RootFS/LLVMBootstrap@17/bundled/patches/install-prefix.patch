starting from llvm14 the install prefix breaks via symlinks;
/usr/lib/llvm14/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake goes up 3 directories to find
/usr/lib/llvm14/include as LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS, but to even use this cmake folder
at all it has to be symlinked to /usr/lib/cmake/llvm .. so the directory it
instead uses is just /usr/include, which is not where the cmake includes are.
this hardcodes them to the install prefix we pass via cmake, which should
always be correct, and what cmake tries to autodetect anyway.

this is supposedly fixed now, but for some reason it still isn't
