Subject: [PATCH] Increase fallback min macOS version for libgcc to 10.8

`-mmacosx-version-min=10.5` seems to cause problems with ld64 from cctools
(https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/10132#issuecomment-2569925646),
and in any case in Julia/BinaryBuilder we support macOS 10.12 at minimum.
