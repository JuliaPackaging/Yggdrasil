# TODO
# - R-scape complains about missing gnuplot at runtime, probably
#   needed for some plots, but works nonetheless

# Bash recipe for building across all platforms
# Notes
# - configure mentions --with-gsl, but the build fails with linking
#   errors using this option (probably -lgsl is missing). Neither this
#   configure option nor GSL are mentioned in the manual, so hopefully
#   GSL isn't needed. I think the flag comes from HMMER, but it seems
#   like the functions that are used from HMMER don't need GSL.
