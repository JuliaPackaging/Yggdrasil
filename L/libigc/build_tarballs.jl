# IGC depends on LLVM, a custom Clang, and a Khronos tool. Instead of building these pieces
# separately, taking care to match versions and apply Intel-specific patches where needed
# (i.e. we can't re-use Julia's LLVM_jll) collect everything here and perform a monolithic,
# in-tree build with known-good versions.

# Collection of sources required to build IGC
# NOTE: these hashes are taken from the release notes in GitHub
# NOTE: the SPIRV-LLVM-Translator doesn't match what's in the release notes,
#       but gets checked out to $SPIRV_REV_PATCH in IGC/VectorCompiler/cmake/spirv.cmake
