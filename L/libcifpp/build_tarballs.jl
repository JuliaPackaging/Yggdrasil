# TODO
# - the CCD (chemical components dictionary) normally gets downloaded
#   by default and saved under share/libcifpp/components.cif, but we
#   don't do this
#
#   This file is quite large (88MB gzipped, 380MB decompressed as of
#   July 2023). Therefore, download and installation of this file is
#   disabled for now, but not sure what functionality is impacted by
#   this. We should maybe think of a better way of sharing
#   components.cif between different packages that need it.
#   Ref: https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd

# Note: we use a newer MacOS SDK to compile on x86_64-apple-darwin
# fixes missing `shared_timed_mutex` and linking problems for
# std::filesystem

# Note: upstream seems to recommend gcc >= 10
#       https://github.com/PDB-REDO/libcifpp/issues/39

# Note: test suite (`make test`) is run if we are building for the
# build host platform BinaryBuilderBase.default_host_platform, which
# is the case for `$target == $MACHTYPE` inside the shell script.
#
# The tests only pass with the correct cxxabi (-cxx11), so we create a
# MACHTYPE_FULL variable to pass to the shell script which can there
# be matched against to bb_full_target.
#
# TODO: can we get the "libgfortran5" from default_host_platform?
#
# Convert x86_64-linux-musl-cxx11 -> x86_64-linux-musl-libgfortran5-cxx11
