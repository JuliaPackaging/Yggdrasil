# Extract a config setting from a previous `config.status` file,
# and create a setting that can be passed to `./configure`. This would look like
#     hdf_cv_PAC_C_MAX_REAL_PRECISION=33
# This setting might contains spaces, and yet it is *not* enclosed in quotes.
# Instead, this script is supposed to be called inside double quotes, as in
#     "$(../get_config_setting PAC_C_MAX_REAL_PRECISION ../config.saved)"
# Shell programming is fun.
