Subject: [PATCH 1/3] programs/ssl: Fix incorrect EOF check in
 ssl_context_info.c

In `read_next_b64_code()`, the result of fgetc() is stored into a char,
but later compared against EOF, which is generally -1.  On platforms
where char is unsigned, this generates a compiler warning/error that the
comparison will never be true (causing a build failure).  The value will
never match, with the function ultimately bailing with a "Too many bad
symbols are detected" error.

On platforms with signed char, EOF is detected, but a file containing a
0xFF character will causes a premature end of file exit of the loop.

Fix this by changing the result to an int.

Fixes #3794.

Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Add a context-info.sh test for 0xFF chars

Add a non-regression test for ssl_context_info to ensure the base64
decoder doesn't stop processing when it encounters a 0xFF character.
