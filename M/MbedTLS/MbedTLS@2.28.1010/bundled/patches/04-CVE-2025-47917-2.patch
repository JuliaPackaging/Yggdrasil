Subject: [PATCH] Restore behaviour of mbedtls_x509write_set_foo_name()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The documentation doesn't say you can't call these functions more than
once on the same context, and if you do it shouldn't result in a memory
leak. Historically, the call to mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() in
mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() (that was removed in the previous commit)
was ensuring that. Let's restore it where it makes sense. (These are the
only 3 places calling mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() in the library.)
